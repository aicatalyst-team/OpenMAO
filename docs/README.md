## Writing Rules

- Prefer short, concrete records over long narrative.
- Link to exact files when decisions depend on repo content.
- Keep secrets, private data, raw logs, and local-only artifacts out of git.
- Keep internal communications, session notes, private strategy debates, and pre-public build-process
  records out of public docs.
- Use issues and pull requests for public implementation history.
